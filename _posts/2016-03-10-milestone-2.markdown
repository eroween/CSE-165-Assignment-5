We have finished the solar system simulator. Planets, moons and comets are in orbit and rotating. In order to have an intuitive simulator, we decided not to represent the solar system in real scale.

Here is the list of the features we have implemented :

- Celestial bodies in orbit
- Celestial bodies in rotation
- Acceleration and deceleration of time.
- Setting solar system to a specific state in future or past.
- Orbit parameters can be changed in real time.

We still need to work on the 3D GUI that can be convenient to use with the ZSpace. And we also need to add more celestial bodies.
