Hi ! We are two extension student, Louis Martin-Pierrat and Roger Lewis, enrolled in CSE 165 at UC San Diego, our final project for this course is a solar system viewer that we have called it “Orrery”.

Our project is a dynamic and interactive solar system representation spanning from the Sun to Pluto with their major moons.

Here is a list of the technical features we want to implement :

1. Representation of the sun, the 8 planets and their moons.
2. Celestial bodies in orbit.
3. Acceleration and deceleration of the orbital speeds.
4. Zoom and focus camera on a specified celestial body.
5. Celestial bodies selection to display information.

In order to do the project, we are going to use Unity 3D and the ZSpace. Moreover we will focus on making a fluid representation of the solar system.

Due date : Thursday, March 3rd at 11:59pm
